To complete the level I took the following steps:
1. Jump on "SmallWall" by increasing jump jumpHeight to ~17f, using "W" (jump) & "D" (right)
2. Jump on "SmallPlatform" (the first one) by increasing jump jumpHeight to ~20f (using "W" & "D")
3. Change "shootAngle" to 0f
4. Move right ("D") to fall on "Floor" while "Enemy" (the first one) is not present
5. Shoot using spacebar
6. Stand under "WidePlatform" (the first one) and change gravity to -0.3f
7. Move right until end of platforms, and then quickly mobe left ("A") until not under spikes. 
8. Change "bulletSpeed" to 40, keep floating and when in range shoot twice to kill both "Enemy"s
9. Move right ("D") until edge of screen, change gravity to positive number, fall down and move left ("A") to yellow square.
